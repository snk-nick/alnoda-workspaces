MkDocs-MagicSpace is an all-in-one tool, carefully crafted to make the development of gorgeous documentation 
websites like [**this one**](https://mkdocs-magicspace.alnoda.org/) as easy as possible.   

## Why documentation websites with MkDocs

*Why create separate documentation websites? And if so, why MkDocs?*

- MkDocs website with beautiful themes looks much better than any readme file. The resulting documentation website looks professional and awesome.
- MkDocs adds text search to your documentation website.
- In the case of closed-source software, sharing readme files from the git repository with external users is not an option.
- Github does not render beautiful extended markdown features like admonitions, tabs, etc. Neither renders diagrams, formulas, swagger docs, or notebooks.
- Using MkDocs-MagicSpace you create documentation from the same markdown readme files you have in your repo together with the code. And you 
can create a unified documentation website from multiple repositories in Github, GitLab, Bitbucket.
- You can add such features as Google Analytics, multi-language localization.
