# Contributing to NBViewer


Welcome! As a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) project,
you can follow the [Jupyter contributor guide](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributor/content-contributor.html).

Make sure to also follow [Project Jupyter's Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/blob/master/conduct/code_of_conduct.md)
for a friendly and welcoming collaborative environment.

## Setting up a development environment

See the instructions for local development or local installation first.

NBViewer has adopted automatic code formatting so you shouldn't
need to worry too much about your code style.
As long as your code is valid,
the pre-commit hook should take care of how it should look. Here is how to set up pre-commit hooks for automatic code formatting, etc.

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

    You can also invoke the pre-commit hook manually at any time with

    ```bash
    pre-commit run
    ```
	
which should run any autoformatting on your code
and tell you about any errors it couldn't fix automatically.
You may also install [black integration](https://github.com/ambv/black#editor-integration)
into your text editor to format code automatically.

If you have already committed files before setting up the pre-commit
hook with `pre-commit install`, you can fix everything up using
`pre-commit run --all-files`.  You need to make the fixing commit
yourself after that.

#### Running the Tests

It's a good idea to write tests to exercise any new features,
or that trigger any bugs that you have fixed to catch regressions. `nose` is used to run the test suite. The tests currently make calls to
external APIs such as GitHub, so it is best to use your Github API Token when
running:

```shell
$ cd <path to repo>
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
$ GITHUB_API_TOKEN=<your token> python setup.py test
```

You can run the tests with:

```bash
nosetests -v
```

in the repo directory.
